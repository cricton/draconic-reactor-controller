# draconic-reactor-controller

Custom script to maximize output of your draconic reactor. Works with Minecraft 1.12.


__Requirements:__

You will need an advanced computer, 20 advanced monitors, 2 flux gates, 3 wired modems and a bunch of networking cables. 
Additionally 4 reactor stabilizer, a draconic reactor core and reactor energy injector are required to set up the reactor.
Several 100 Millions of rf, ideally stored in a draconic energy core.

__Setup:__

The back of the advanced computer needs to be attached to a reactor stabilized, the right side of it needs to be attached to a flux gate. This is the side that energy gets extracted from, therefore the flux gate needs to be rotated and connected to the stabilizer in such a way that energy can be extracted.

One wired modem needs to be attached to the top of the advanced computer, andother one needs to be attached to a 4x5 advanced monitor. The last wired modem needs to be connected to the flux gate that manages how much power is supplied to the reactor energy injector. Make sure to right click the modems to turn them on.

To run the program open the advanced computer and type "pastebin getaGrPQ2AQ" and then execute "install".

The following pictures show how everything needs to be set up.

__Usage:__

Try to keep the generator at the maximum amount of fuel (8 blocks of awakened draconium) when refueling. The reactor will shut down automatically if more than 80% of the supplied fuel has been used up.
